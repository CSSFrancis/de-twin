"""Reference 4D-STEM reconstructions that check twin data actually reconstructs.

Test helpers only, not part of the de_twin package: the twin produces data, and
reconstruction belongs to the tools people use (numpy only).

* :func:`tcbf` - tilt-corrected bright field / parallax: per-pixel virtual BF images, their
  cross-correlation shifts fitted to the probe aberrations (C1, A1, scan rotation, optionally
  B2 / A2), shift-and-sum image.
* :func:`epie` - single-slice ePIE ptychography with a known (or refined) probe;
  :func:`probe_from_aberrations`, :func:`object_on_grid` and :func:`phase_correlation` help set
  it up from ``DigitalTwin.ground_truth_ptychography`` and score it.
